## Challenge Overview
# Overview of Election Audit: 
The purpose of this audit was to determine which county had the biggest turnout. This is important information to have because elections can be greatly impacted by counties or states with larger popoulations and/or largest turnouts.

## Challenge Summary

Elections are future-defining instruments to accomplish social and political change. As such, they must be treated with great respect and their integrity must be carefully protected. Audtis like the one we just worked on are a way to do so. On this note, one of the advantages of such scripts is that they can be used for future election audits, since many parts of the code can be modified to fit different candidates, vote amount or counties. It can even include more voter information to get a broader sense of the voting pool such as age, SSN or gender, among many others.
